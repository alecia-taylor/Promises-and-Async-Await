# Promises and Async/Await

This repository provides a hands-on walkthrough of JavaScript's `Promise` and `async/await` syntax. It's designed as a learning tool for developers looking to deepen their understanding of asynchronous programming in JavaScript with clear, practical examples.

## 🚀 What’s Inside

- ✅ Basic Promise creation and usage  
- 🔁 Chaining `.then()` and handling errors with `.catch()`  
- ⏳ Simulating async operations with `setTimeout`  
- 🔄 Refactoring Promises into `async/await`  
- 🧪 Practice examples to reinforce concepts

Each section builds on the previous one, helping you get comfortable with both syntaxes and understand where each one shines.

## 🧠 Why It Matters

JavaScript is non-blocking by nature, which makes async programming critical. Understanding how to work with Promises and `async/await` is foundational for building modern web apps, handling API calls, or managing any form of delayed execution.

## 🔧 How to Run

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alecia-taylor/Promises-and-Async-Await.git
